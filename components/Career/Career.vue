                            While working with clients on their websites, I advanced Eternity's tech stack, helping to

                            that time I helped revolutionize our web process, and spent my time crafting websites and
                            innovating on the side.

                            After my internship with Eternity, I was asked to come on as a part time developer. I
                            started taking on my own projects, and even released a few websites entirely self
                            programmed.
